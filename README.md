 # Variational-Autoencoder
Contains the maltab code for VAE

Code.m -> runs the VAE code on frey face dataset with gradient descent
NN.m  -> Calculates ELBO (Evidence lower bound) for a single VAE
Error.m -> Calculated the total ELBO value
derivat.m -> Calculates the derivative of ELBO via Back-propagation on a single observation
Complete_deriv.m -> Calculates the complete derivative of ELBO via backpropagation
